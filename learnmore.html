            <h1>7 Must-Have Tools for Cryptocurrency Traders</h1>
            <p>The digital money trade has already claimed its seat along with such serious 
                financial disciplines as traditional trading, forex, options, and trade with shares. 
                To begin with, cryptocurrency trading is currently the hardest game on Earth right now.
                 However, the allure of being a new crypto-millionaire is enticing. 
                 There are tools that help with that.<br>

                The profitability of cryptocurrencies, first of all, comprises their considerable volatility.
                 Exchange rates during the day, in contrast to the classical exchange, can reach amplitudes of several hundred percent.<br>
                
                Such reactivity causes crypto traders to be much faster than their classic counterparts.
                 They have to pass through a massive flow of information, to screen out uncontrolled injections 
                 and learn how to make correct predictions.
                 <br><br>
                This article discusses several tools that will help the newcomer become “the wolf of BitcoinTalk.”<br><br>
                
                The 7 must-have tools for cryptocurrency traders are:<br><br>
                
                BitcoinTalk<br><br>
                Coinmarketcap<br><br>
                Cryptocompare<br><br>
                Blockfolio<br><br>
                Coinview<br><br>
                CoinmarketCal & Coinspectator<br><br>
                ICORating & ICOStats

                <h1>BitcoinTalk</h1>
                 This is the leading cryptocurrency forum in the world,
                 created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the largest repository of information on cryptocurrencies.
                
                Blockchain, smart contracts, altcoins, mining – 
                these topics are actively discussed on a monthly basis by more than 20 million people
                 from all over the world. Each new ICO project has its own thread, where it can publish announcements
                  and receive feedback from the community.

                  <h1>Coinmarketcap</h1>
                 This is the primary information registry of data in the market. Convenient tools allow you to find a particular coin or token in a couple of clicks, view its financial data, list of supported exchanges, as well as links to the social networks and official website.

                The site is divided into four blocks:

               The “Market value” part is responsible for coins, tokens, and their weighted averages;<br><br>
               “Trading volume” – a figure calculated by combining all trading of that particular asset across every supporting exchange, over a 24hr period;<br><br>
                The “Trends” section allows you to build a table of leading and lagging trading pairs on the given parameters;<br><br>
               “Additional tools” – provides a set of convenient tools, such as a currency converter.
               Not so long ago the service added integration with the Changelly exchange for the purchase of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC.
